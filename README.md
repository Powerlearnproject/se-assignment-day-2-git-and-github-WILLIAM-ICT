## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system that tracks and manages changes to code over time, allowing developers to collaborate and maintain project integrity. Key concepts include:

1. **Repository**: A storage space for the code.
2. **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made at a specific time.
3. **Branch**: A separate version of the code to work on features or fixes.
4. **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches.
5. **Clone**: A copy of a repository on a local machine.
6. **Pull/Push**: Syncing changes between local and remote repositories.

**GitHub** is popular for managing code versions because it uses Git, a distributed version control system, and offers easy collaboration with features like branching, pull requests, and issue tracking. It integrates with CI/CD tools and has a large community for open-source projects.

Version control ensures project integrity by tracking changes, allowing easy rollback to previous versions, supporting collaboration without conflicts, and providing backup and recovery options. It helps maintain code quality and stability throughout the development process.
